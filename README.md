In this project we conducted an in-depth analysis of the World Happiness Report dataset, which comprises global survey data
assessing a variety of factors that influence subjective well-being, such as social support, freedom of choice, and
generosity. Leveraged statistical techniques to identify key drivers of happiness and explore their relationships
with other socio-economic variables.

o Cleaned and normalized survey data, using ggplot2 and corrplot to visualize correlations and relationships
between key variables.

o Built linear regression models to analyze relationships between variables, with hypothesis testing and
confidence interval calculations.

o Applied Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest regressions, optimizing model performance and comparing
RMSE values for predictive accuracy.

o Used cross-validation to ensure model reliability and incorporated interaction terms to capture complex
relationships
